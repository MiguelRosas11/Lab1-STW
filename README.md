# ERROR:404 – Interactive Story

This project is an interactive story developed for the course *Tecnologías y Sistemas Web*.  
The story allows the user to navigate through different paths using only HTML and links, without CSS or JavaScript, as required in the assignment.


## Project Structure

The project is organized in folders:

- `paginas/` – Contains all HTML pages of the story  
- `assets/img/` – Images used in each page  
- `README.md` – This documentation file  

## About the Story

The story follows a user who finds an old computer that shows mysterious options on the screen.  
Each decision leads to a different page and eventually to one of three possible endings:

- **Good ending** – The system is restored  
- **Neutral ending** – Nothing changes  
- **Bad ending** – The system fails  

## Navigation

Every page contains:

- A short text (3–4 lines)  
- At least one image  
- Links to two different paths  
- Header, body, and footer structure  

The user can move between pages using normal HTML links.
